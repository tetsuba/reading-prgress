The Display component is a simple component that conditionally renders its children based on a value prop.
It accepts the following props:
children - The JSX element(s) to render
value - A boolean indicating whether to render the children or not
It renders the children passed to it if value is true, otherwise it renders nothing.
So this component acts like a conditional wrapper - it will show or hide its child content based on the value prop.
Some ways it could be used:
To show or hide a modal/overlay based on a isOpen state
To show a message/component if some condition is met
As a wrapper for animations that should only render when value is true
So in summary, it conditionally displays the children if value is true, otherwise displays nothing. It's a simple but useful component for conditionally showing/hiding content.
