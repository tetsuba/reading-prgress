      "story": "Mr Mystery came from a faraway land. He could juggle with fire, and walk on his hands. He could conjure a flock of doves out of thin air. For a special occasion, he had to be there. We met him one morning we thought he looked glum. He said \"children I'm sorry, the moment has come\". \"I've made my decision it's time to retire\". \"You may laugh, but i've had enough playing with fire\". His final performance was something to see. It ended with fireworks at a quarter to three. His little blue boat sailed out on the ocean. Though nobody saw it in all the commotion. A letter arrives from a faraway land. \"Hope to visit you some day. My new life is grand!\" Mr Mystery",
